Since proxied contracts do not make use of a constructor, it's common to move constructor logic to an\\n * external initializer function, usually called `initialize`. It then becomes necessary to protect this initializer\\n * function so it can only be called once. The {initializer} modifier provided by this contract will have this effect.\\n *\\n * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as\\n * possible by providing the encoded function call as the `_data` argument to {ERC1967Proxy-constructor}.\\n *\\n * CAUTION: When used with inheritance, manual care must be taken to not invoke a parent initializer twice, or to ensure\\n * that all initializers are idempotent. This is not verified automatically as constructors are by Solidity.\\n *\\n * [CAUTION]\\n * ====\\n * Avoid leaving a contract uninitialized.\\n *\\n * An uninitialized contract can be taken over by an attacker. This applies to both a proxy and its implementation\\n * contract, which may impact the proxy. To initialize the implementation contract, you can either invoke the\\n * initializer manually, or you can include a constructor to automatically mark it as initialized when it is deployed:\\n *\\n * [.hljs-theme-light.nopadding]\\n * ```\\n * /// @custom:oz-upgrades-unsafe-allow constructor\\n * constructor() initializer {}\\n * ```\\n * ====\\n */\\nabstract contract Initializable {\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract has been initialized.\\n     */\\n    bool private _initialized;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Indicates that the contract is in the process of being initialized.\\n     */\\n    bool private _initializing;\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Modifier to protect an initializer function from being invoked twice.\\n     */\\n    modifier initializer() {\\n        // If the contract is initializing we ignore whether _initialized is set in order to support multiple\\n        // inheritance patterns, but we only do this in the context of a constructor, because in other contexts the\\n        // contract may have been reentered.\\n        require(_initializing ? _isConstructor() : !_initialized, \\\"Initializable: contract is already initialized\\\");\\n\\n        bool isTopLevelCall = !_initializing;\\n        if (isTopLevelCall) {\\n            _initializing = true;\\n            _initialized = true;\\n        }\\n\\n        _;\\n\\n        if (isTopLevelCall) {\\n            _initializing = false;\\n        }\\n    }\\n\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Modifier to protect an initialization function so that it can only be invoked by functions with the\\n     * {initializer} modifier, directly or indirectly.\\n     */\\n    modifier onlyInitializing() {\\n        require(_initializing, \\\"Initializable: contract is not initializing\\\");\\n        _;\\n    }\\n\\n    function _isConstructor() private view returns (bool) {\\n        return !AddressUpgradeable.isContract(address(this));\\n    }\\n}\\n\",\"keccak256\":\"0x372b0bc04e3b4c074559bbbfb1317afddb56de5504158ca25a7f9cd403980445\",\"license\":\"MIT\"},\"@openzeppelin/contracts-upgradeable/utils/AddressUpgradeable.sol\":{\"content\":\"// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT\\n// OpenZeppelin Contracts (last updated v4.5.0) (utils/Address.sol)\\n\\npragma solidity ^0.8.1;\\n\\n/**\\n * @dev Collection of functions related to the address type\\n */\\nlibrary AddressUpgradeable {\\n    /**\\n     * @dev Returns true if `account` is a contract.\\n     *\\n     * [IMPORTANT]\\n     * ====\\n     * It is unsafe to assume that an address for which this function returns\\n     * false is an externally-owned account (EOA) and not a contract.\\n     *\\n     * Among others, `isContract` will return false for the following\\n     * types of addresses:\\n     *\\n     *  - an externally-owned account\\n     *  - a contract in construction\\n     *  - an address where a contract will be created\\n     *  - an address where a contract lived, but was destroyed\\n     * ====\\n     *\\n     * [IMPORTANT]\\n     * ====\\n     * You shouldn't rely on `isContract` to protect against flash loan attacks!\\n     *\\n     * Preventing calls from contracts is highly discouraged.
